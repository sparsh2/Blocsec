1. Enter the username
2. Create multiple threads for listening - listening threads
3. Whenever a new transaction is generated in the main thread, add it to a map(transaction_id,listofrandnum[])
4. While adding the transaction, store it in a timestamped order.
5. Also, send the transaction to peers along with a random number for the transaction.
6. Whenever you listen a transaction from peers, add it to your map in the timestamped order and respond
   with a random number. 
7. Create another thread which checks for the length of listofrandnum[] - thread_mine
8. Wait until len(listofrandnum)!=len(active_users)
9. Then, create a block of the transaction and add it to the blockchain. 
(Doubt) I think it should be like someone else should verify your blockchain.
